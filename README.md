# Dean's AVR Tutorials

## About

These are a collection of tutorials I've written, in LaTeX format. These cover a range of Atmel AVR related concepts, intended to teach people how to, for example, use the hardware timers on the Atmel AVR 8-bit series of microcontrollers. Pregenerated PDFs are available for easy download and distribution.

## Regenerating the PDFs

I use [MikTex](http://miktex.org) to generate PDFs from the LaTeX source on my Windows machine, however any LaTeX distribution should work. Run `make` from the root directory to regenerate the PDFs for each tutorial, or run `make` from inside a tutorial's directory to generate the PDF output of that tutorial only.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Please file issues, or make pull requests, if you find something that could be improved or is incorrect in any of these tutorials.

## Distribution

See the [raw Preface text](Preface.tex) for the exact license conditions, but the overall intention is that these tutorials are to reach as many people as possible, for free. Translations into other languages are welcome!
